There are only two number in binary system one is 0 and second is 1.
This is an important part of computer as it give instruction to the digital electronics to on/ off.
Addition in binary number when we add 1 + 0 its answer is 1 for o + 1 it is 1 similarly 0 + 0 is 0
but when we add 1 + 1 its answer is 10( carry 1 ) as 1 + 1 is 2 but in binary we write 2 as 10.
