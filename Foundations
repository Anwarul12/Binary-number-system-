There are only two number in binary system one is 0 and second is 1.
This is an important part of computer as it give instruction to the digital electronics to on/ off.
In class we learn to convert real to binary number there are such steps which we need to follow-
1) first we devide the number by 2.
2) write the remainder.
3) Repeat this process until quotient becomes 0.
4) last step, In this we need to just write the all remainders from base to top.

Example-
Convert 15 to binary-
15/2 = quotient 7 and remainder 1 
7/2 = quotient 3 and remainder 1 
3/2 = quotient 1 and remainder 1 
1/2 = quotient 0 and remainder 1 
Now we have to write all remainders from base to top which is = 1111
So, the binary no of 15 is 1111

Similarly to convert binary no to real we need to follow some steps-
1) first we write the given binary number.
2) We start from right to left then we multiply first binary no with 2^0 second one with 2^1
third one with 2 ^2 and so on and after multiplying we add all the results.

Example- 
convert 1111 to binary-
1 x 2^0 = 1
1 x 2^1 = 2
1 x 2^2 = 4
1 x 2^3 = 8
sum of all answers = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15

Addition in binary number when we add 1 + 0 its answer is 1 for o + 1 it is 1 
similarly 0 + 0 is 0
but when we add 1 + 1 its answer is 10( carry 1 ) as 1 + 1 is 2 but in binary we write 2 as 10.
