Two's complement is a method  where we  represent a positive or negative intiger in binary.
we need to follow these steps-
1) First we have to convert the  number to binary ( In 8- bit form positive ).
2) Now flip 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 ( also it is called one's complement ).
3) Add 1 in result.

Example-
To represent 5 in 8 bit two's complement.
first,convert 5 to binary-
5/2 = quotient = 2 remainder = 1
2/2 = quotient = 1 remainder = 0
1/2 = quotient = 0 remainder = 1
result = 101 
in 8 bit form = 00000101
One's complement = 11111010
Add 1 
11111010 + 1 = 11111011
so -5 in 8 bit two's complement is 11111011.
